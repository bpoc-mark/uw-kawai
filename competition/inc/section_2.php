                    <p>At KAWAI MUSIC SCHOOL, we have been engaged in our music education activities with the goals of "learn through music, not just learn music", "not just aim to acquire techniques" and "nurture individuality and make a richer personality through activities to express oneself through music" based on our educational philosophy, "Through music, we guide the irreplaceable personality of each student, and through mutual respect for each person's personality, we create the joy of communicating and resonating with others".</p>
                    <p>It is thanks to the understanding and cooperation of all of you that we were able to hold this competition for the first time, inheriting the spirit of KAWAI MUSIC COMPETITION, "actively evaluate spontaneous musical expression rather than superiority or inferiority of technique", which is based on the educational philosophy of Kawai Music School.  <br>
                        We would like to express our deepest gratitude.</p>

            <p>We hope that every participant will be able to demonstrate in this competition the "eagerness to express your own music" that comes from the joy of creating your own music and the excitement of delivering music to other people.</p>
            <p>Although the spread of the novel coronavirus is not yet under control and the situation is still severe, we hope that this competition will help you to rediscover the importance and necessity of music and make your musical life more meaningful and enriching. <br>
                We sincerely look forward to your participation.
            </p>
